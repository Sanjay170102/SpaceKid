                        <h3>ASTEROID</h3>
                        <p>Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. They are sometimes called minor planets or planetoids.
                            Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt, a region of space between Mars and Jupiter. There are believed to be more than a million asteroids in the asteroid belt, with sizes ranging from tiny particles to objects hundreds of miles wide.
                            Asteroids come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are spherical, while others are irregularly shaped. Some asteroids even have moons of their own.    
                            The largest known asteroid is Ceres, which has a diameter of about 590 miles (940 kilometers). Ceres is also considered a dwarf planet, because it is large enough to have a roughly spherical shape and has cleared its orbit of other objects. 
                            Asteroids can be made up of different types of material, including rock, metal, and ice. Some asteroids are believed to be made up of the same material as the Earth's crust.
                            Collisions between asteroids and other objects in space can create new asteroids or break up existing ones. Some asteroids are believed to be fragments of larger objects that were destroyed in collisions.</p>

                        <h3>METEROID</h3>
                        <p>Meteoroids are small pieces of rock and metal that travel through space. They can range in size from tiny grains of sand to boulders several meters in diameter.
                            Meteoroids are formed when asteroids or comets collide and break apart. The resulting debris is scattered throughout space and can eventually enter Earth's atmosphere as a meteor.
                            Most meteoroids burn up in Earth's atmosphere and never reach the ground. These are often referred to as shooting stars.
                            The largest meteoroid ever recorded to hit Earth's atmosphere was the Tunguska event in 1908. The meteoroid was estimated to be around 60 meters in diameter and exploded in the air, causing a shockwave that flattened trees over an area of 2,000 square kilometers.
                            Some meteoroids are made of iron and nickel, while others are made of rock and ice. The composition of a meteoroid can give scientists clues about its origin and history.
                            Meteoroids can travel at incredible speeds, with some reaching speeds of up to 70 kilometers per second (156,000 miles per hour).</p>
